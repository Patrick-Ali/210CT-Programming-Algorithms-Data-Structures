It is important to note that in terms of version control that there are old versions of the code on at the link
that were used as my version of version control. In additon to using this site I also used the Cloud 9 as my primary
development enviorment. This can be found here:

The following report is writen in C++11 with pusedo code provided for the reelevant parts of each question.
As reproducing the psedou code for the user input and out put will become redundant so I will focus on producing it 
for the main functions of the program. 

Inital problems will have Big O notation included so as to demonstrate the worst case runtime of the program. Much
like the psedo code I will not be giving Big O notation for the input and output for evey prgram as it will not change
majorly program to program.

As such the following report will be layed out as such:
Psedou Code
Problem  Solved in C++11
Big O notation for inital few 

In regards to the psedou code it has been formated through the Latex Algorithms package
meaning that the comments will be denoted by a hollow arrow head rather than the '\\' which 
may be used else where. 


To note the following standard template libary objects will be used where aplicable 
Vector
Stack
Que 

As such I will be using the follwing website to determine their Big O notation where applicable:
http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~riesbeck/programming/c++/stl-summary.html 

So as to give you a fell for the way the document will be laid out I will produce the psedocode and Big O notation for
the general input and output for each program.

Input:

Output:

Where I fell I may have been influenced by a particualr piece of code, either pusedo or real it will be shown
