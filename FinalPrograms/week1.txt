Input:
Shuffle has an input of an array of integers 
trailingZero has an input of an integer

Output
Shuffle outputs a shuffled version of the given array
TrailingZero outputs an integer that indicates the number of trailing zeros the 
number has when factorised

Gaurante Termination 
Shuffle will terminate as once the array has been shuffled with in the range 
10-20 it will output the array
TrailingZero will terminate once the given number being divided by 5^n reaches 
zero and then it will output the answer

can i give the code to someone and they understand it

i have tested x number of times and it produces correct number of results and thus it will likely do it for all
